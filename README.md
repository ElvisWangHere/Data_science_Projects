We will use the **Boston house price dataset** for this project. **Data source:** https://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston. Each record in the database describes a house in Boston suburb or town. The data was drawn from the Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) in 1970.

## **Objective**
The problem at hand is to **predict the housing prices of a town or a suburb based on the features of the locality provided to us**. In the process, we need to **identify the most important features affecting the price of the house**. We need to employ techniques of data preprocessing and build a linear regression model that predicts the prices for the unseen data.
